The purpose of this website was to host a web version as well as native version of a simple sorting application. The main focus of this project was not to build a professional quality website or application. The purpose of this was simply to choose a simple application and build both a web and a native desktop version of the application and host it on a product website. Currently, the native desktop download is only available for macOS systems. 

The web version of this sorting application was built on top of a C++ engine, transpiled with emscripten into Web Assembly (WASM), and used as a JavaScript library wrapped around frontend html code. The native desktop version of the application used Electron to take the already existing web version and convert it into a desktop application.
